    Execute a list of Word Bites moves in order, prioritizing high-scoring words first.
    
    The moves are pre-sorted by optimize_word_order to prioritize:
    1. Words with the highest point values first
    2. Groups of related words with similar point values (within a 400-point threshold)
    3. Shorter words before longer words within each group
    
    Words that are related (like "think", "thinks", "thinker") with similar scores will be executed
    back-to-back with shorter delays between them, improving efficiency while still
    prioritizing the highest-scoring words overall.
    
    For related words (e.g., "ICEWORM" and "ICEWORMS"), the function will attempt to build
    upon the previous word rather than rebuilding the entire word from scratch, which
    significantly improves efficiency.
    
    The function ensures words don't have leading or trailing unrelated letters,
    so "UNTHINK" and "THINK" would not be considered related despite sharing
    a common stem.
